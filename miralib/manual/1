The manual is menu driven, and is  a  separate  subsystem  that  can  be
invoked from the Miranda command interpreter.  To access the manual from
Miranda, type
        /man
followed by return.  To access the  manual  directly  from  the  command
line, without entering Miranda first, type the line
	mira -man
as a shell command.

On entering the manual system  a  contents  page  is  displayed  listing
numbered  sections.   In  response  to the question at the bottom of the
page you should enter the number of the section  you  wish  to  see  and
press  return  (i.e.   ENTER).   The  contents  of that section are then
displayed to you.  When you are ready to leave the manual, press return,
without  giving  ay  section  number, in response to the question at the
foot of the contents page - typing q (for "quit") has the same effect.

If the section is more than one page long, you should  press  the  space
bar when you have finished reading a page, in order to see the next page
(or press return to see one more line).  At the end of the section,  you
may press return to go back to the contents page.

The manual is organised in short sections, each at  most  two  or  three
screenfulls long.  Where a section would otherwise be too long to fit in
with this philosophy, the  manual  is  organised  recursively  and  will
display a subsidiary contents page, with a list of numbered subsections,
which you may read, as before, by typing  the  appropriate  number.   To
return  to  the  main  menu from a submenu, press return with no section
number, in response to the question at the bottom of the page.

The manual is intended to provide online documentation  of  the  Miranda
programming language and the command system in which it is embedded.  It
is not intended to be a tutorial on functional programming.  It does not
provide  information  about  the  operating  system,  for which separate
documentation is available (but there is a section on  the  Miranda/UNIX
interface).

Whenever the manual system prompts the user for input -  by  asking  for
"next selection" - the complete repertoire of possible responses is:

q 	   quit the manual
<return>   exit one level of menu structure
		(i.e. if at foot of section, return to menu
		      if at submenu, return to master menu
		      if at main menu, quit the manual)
<number>   display section from current contents page
.  	   (dot) same again, i.e. redisplay last requested section 
+  	   display next section in numerical order
-          display previous section
!command   temporary escape to O/S, executes shell command

Individual sections of the manual are displayed to you  using  the  UNIX
program  `more'  or an equivalent such as `less' (you can change this by
setting an environment variable VIEWER (*)).  These programs have  their
own  UNIX  manual page describing their features.  The responses you can
give generally include

[SPACE]	   display next screenful
[return]   display one more line
q          (quit) cease showing me this file
b          (back) scroll backwards by one screenful
/context   search for context (eg a word)
?context   search backwards for context
h          help

interface.
