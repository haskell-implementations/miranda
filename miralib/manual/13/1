The following abbreviations are provided for  denoting  lists,  of  type
[num],  whose  members form a finite or infinite arithmetic series.  Let
`a', `b', `c' stand for arbitrary numeric expressions.

	[a..b]	   list of numbers from a to b inclusive, interval = 1
	[a..]      infinite list starting at a and increasing by 1
	[a,b..c]   arithmetic series, first member a, second member b,
		   last member not greater than c (if b-a non-negative)
		   or not less than c (if b-a negative).
	[a,b..]    infinite series starting at a, interval = (b-a)

So the notation [1..10] has as value  the  list  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].
Here are some more examples

	nats = [0..]
	evens = [0,2..]
	odds_less_than_100 = [1,3..99]
	neg_odds = [-1,-3..]
	tenths = [1.0,1.1 .. 2.0]
