The word `Miranda' is not an acronym.  It is a proper name (like `ADA').

"Miranda (f).  From the Latin meaning `to be admired'.   This  name  was
first used by Shakespeare for the heroine of `The Tempest', a young girl
blessed with many admirable qualities.  Like other unusual Shakespearean
names it has been used quite frequently in the 20th century."

"O wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! O brave new world."

never be written all in capitals.
