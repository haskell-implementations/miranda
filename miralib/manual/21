These enable a new data type to be defined by data type abstraction from
an existing type.  We give the classic example, that of defining `stack'
as an abstract data type (here based on lists)
	_a_b_s_t_y_p_e stack *
	_w_i_t_h empty::stack *
	     push::*->stack *->stack *
	     isempty::stack *->bool
	     top::stack *->*
	     pop::stack *->stack *

	stack * == [*]
	empty = []
	push a x = a:x
	isempty x = x=[]
	top (a:x) = a
	pop (a:x) = x

The information given after  `_w_i_t_h'  is  called  the  _s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e  of  the
abstract  type - the definitions of the identifiers in the signature are
called the `implementation equations' (these are the six equations given
above).   Outside  of  the implementation equations the information that
stacks are implemented as lists is not available  -  []  and  empty  for
example  are incomparable objects of two different and unrelated types (
[*] and stack * respectively).  Only inside the implementation equations
are   the   abstract  objects  treated  as  being  equivalent  to  their
representations.

The implementation equations do not have to appear immediately after the
corresponding  _a_b_s_t_y_p_e  declaration  -  they  can  occur anywhere in the
script.  For readability, however, it is strongly recommended  that  the
implementation   equations   appear   immediately   after   the  _a_b_s_t_y_p_e
declaration.

Note  that  in  Miranda  there  is  no  runtime  cost  associated   with
administering  an  abstract data type.  The responsibility for enforcing
the distinction between stacks and lists,  for  example,  is  discharged
entirely   at   compile   time  (by  the  type  checker).   The  runtime
representation of a stack does not require any extra bits to distinguish
it  from  a  list.   As  a  result the Miranda programmer can freely use
abstract data types to structure his programs without incurring any loss
of efficiency by doing so.

Notice that the mechanism used  to  introduce  abstract  data  types  in
Miranda  does  not  depend  on  the  hiding  of identifiers, and in this
respect differs from the traditional approach.  A fuller  discussion  of
the Miranda _a_b_s_t_y_p_e mechanism can be found in [*Turner 85].

Values  belonging  to an abstract type are not in general printable.  If
the value of a command-level expression  is  of  such  a  type  it  will
normally print simply as

<abstract ob>

This is because the special function _s_h_o_w (which is actually a family of
functions, see elsewhere) has no  general  method  for  converting  such
objects to a printable form.  It is possible to extend the definition of
_s_h_o_w to include the ability to print members of an abstract type,  using
some appropriate format.  The convention for doing this is to include in
the definition of the abstract type a function with the  name  `showfoo'
(where `foo' is the name of the abstract type involved).

We illustrate how this is done taking `stack' as the  example.   Suppose
we  decide we wish stacks to print - using a syntax such that the output
could be read back in (e.g. by readvals - see elsewhere) to generate the
same stack.

 empty is to print as "empty"
 push 1 empty is to print as "(push 1 empty)"
 and so on.

Note that we decide to fully parenthesise the output for safety -  since
we  do  not  know  the  larger  context in which our stack output may be
embedded.

Because  `stack'  is  a  polymorphic abstraction, showstack will need to
take as a parameter the appropriate show function for the  element  type
(which  is num in the above examples, but could have been any type).  We
add to the signature of stack the following function.

     showstack::(*->[char])->stack *->[char]

To obtain the output format illustrated above, an appropriate definition
of showstack would be,

    showstack f [] = "empty"
    showstack f (a:x) = "(push " ++ f a ++ " " ++ showstack f x ++ ")"

If this definition is included in the script, stacks  become  printable,
using  the  specified  format.  The effect is to extend the behaviour of
the special built-in function  _s_h_o_w  to  handle  stacks,  and  all  data
structures  built using stacks (such as list of tree of stacks, stack of
stacks and so on).

The general rule is as follows.  Let `foo' be an abstract type name.  To
make foo's printable, we need to define a `showfoo' thus:

	if foo is a simple type (not polymorphic)
	showfoo :: foo -> [char]

	if foo is polymorphic in one type variable (foo *)
	showfoo :: (*->[char]) -> foo * -> [char]

	if foo is polymorphic in two type variables (foo * **)
	showfoo :: (*->[char]) -> (**->[char]) -> foo * ** -> [char]

and so on.  Note  that  the  show  function  must  be  declared  in  the
signature  of  the  abstract  type, and that the name of the function is
significant - if we change its name from  `showfoo'  to  `gobbledegook',
its  definition  will cease to have any effect on the behaviour of _s_h_o_w.
It also needs to have the right type, and if  it  does  not,  again  its
presence  will have no effect on the behaviour of _s_h_o_w (in this case the
compiler prints a warning message).

[Note on library directives: If you %export an abstract type,  foo  say,
to  another  file,  it  is not necessary to %export the showfoo function
explicitly to preserve the correct printing behaviour - if  an  abstract
type  comes  into  existence  with  a show function in its signature the
compiler will `remember' how to print objects of the type even in scopes
where the show function has no name.]
