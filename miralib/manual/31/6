The Miranda system uses two main internal workspaces called  "heap"  and
"dic".   If  either overflows during a session, a self explanatory error
message is given.  The sizes of both areas may changed by  the  user  if
required.   Any  change made is remembered thereafter and for subsequent
sessions until countermanded.

The heap contains almost all the data structures  created  both  by  the
Miranda  compiler and the evaluation system.  To compile and/or run very
large scripts you may need a bigger heap.   To  find  out  (change)  the
current size of the heap say
	/heap		(or /heap newsize  e.g.   /heap 2000000 )

The heap size may also be altered by using  a  flag  (see  below).   You
should  be  aware  that running Miranda processes with a very large heap
may give you slower responses.

The dictionary is used to  store  identifiers  and  file  names  by  the
Miranda  compiler.  It is unlikely that you will need to change the size
of  the  dictionary.   The  current  size  of  the  dictionary  can   be
ascertained by the command
	/dic

it  cannot  be  changed dynamically, from within the Miranda system.  To
alter the dictionary size use a flag (see next para).

The sizes of either or both areas may be set by flags when invoking  the
miranda system.  The following shows both possibilities
	mira -dic 80000 -heap 2000000 [script]

Note that the size of the heap is given in `cells' (a cell is  9  bytes,
currently) and the size of the dictionary is in bytes.

The  most  recent settings of the workspace sizes are stored in the file
".mirarc" in the users home directory, and automatically carried over to
the next miranda session.
