The behaviour of the `mira' program is  sensitive  to  the  settings  of
certain environment variables.

An alternative location for the miralib directory may  be  specified  by
setting  the  environment variable "MIRALIB".  An explicit -lib flag, if
present, overrides this.

The  first time it is called (i.e. if no .mirarc file is present, either
in the home directory or in miralib) the miranda  system  picks  up  the
name  of  the  resident editor from the environment variable EDITOR - if
this is not set it assumes `vi'.

At startup (version 2.044 and later) `mira' inspects LC_CTYPE or if that
is  empty  LANG,  to  determine  if it is running in a UTF-8 locale.  On
Windows/Cygwin this information is taken  from  the  "user-default  ANSI
code page".  The flag -UTF-8 or -noUTF-8, if present, overrides.

If the environment variable RECHECKMIRA is set (to any non-empty string)
the  Miranda  system  rechecks  to see if any relevant source files have
been updated, and performs  any  necessary  recompilation,  before  each
interaction  with the user - this is the appropriate behaviour if an (eg
emacs) editor window is being kept open permanently during  the  Miranda
session.   If  this  environment  variable  is  not  set,  the  check is
performed only after `/e' commands and `!' escapes.

To decide  what  shell  to  use  in  `!'  escapes,  mira  looks  in  the
environment  variable  SHELL (this will normally contain the name of the
user's login shell).  If no SHELL is entered in the environment, /bin/sh
is assumed.

If environment variable MIRAPROMPT is set, its contents will be used  as
the  session  prompt,  instead of the default prompt "Miranda " (version
2.044 and later).

If the environment variable NOSTRICTIF is set (to any non-empty  string)
Miranda accepts old scripts with no `if' after the guard comma.

For displaying pages of the manual mira uses the program entered in  the
environment  as  VIEWER  -  if  this  variable is not set the default is
likely to be 'more -d' or (roughly equivalent) 'less -EX'.

If you set VIEWER to something, you may also need to set an  environment
variable RETURNTOMENU.

RETURNTOMENU=YES prevents another prompt being  given  after  displaying
each  section, causing instead an immediate return to contents page.  It
should be `YES' if VIEWER is a program that pauses for input at  end  of
file (eg "less"), `NO' if VIEWER is a program that quits silently at end
of file (eg "more", "less -EX").

Finally note that a third environment variable MENUVIEWER can be set  to
choose  the  program  used to display contents pages (by default this is
normally 'cat' or 'more').

To find the current settings of these display commands enter
	???
to the "next selection" prompt of the manual system.

Example, setting the environment variable VIEWER to /usr/local/view

 (i) if you use a Bourne-like shell (sh ksh bash)
     say at the UNIX command level (i.e. before calling Miranda)

     export VIEWER=/usr/local/view

     to undo the above say `unset VIEWER',
     to make permanent add this line to your .profile or .bashrc

 (ii) if you use a C shell (csh tcsh)
      say at the UNIX command level (i.e. before calling Miranda)

      setenv VIEWER /usr/local/view

      to undo the above say `unsetenv VIEWER',
      to make permanent add the setenv line to your .login or .cshrc
