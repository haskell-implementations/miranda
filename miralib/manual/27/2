Suppose the file "mylib.m" contains  some  Miranda  declarations  (which
could be any kind of legal Miranda declaration, eg function definitions,
type definitions etc).  To make these in scope in  another  script,  the
latter will contain the directive
	%_i_n_c_l_u_d_e "mylib"

This  can  come  anywhere  in  the  script  (there  is  for  example  no
requirement  that  %_i_n_c_l_u_d_e directives come at the front) but must be at
top level - you may not  place  a  %_i_n_c_l_u_d_e  directive  inside  a  _w_h_e_r_e
clause.  The subject of a %_i_n_c_l_u_d_e directive may itself contain %_i_n_c_l_u_d_e
directives, and so on (to any reasonable depth).

By  default,  the names `exported' from an included script are all those
defined in it at top level, but  not  those  of  subsidiary  %_i_n_c_l_u_d_e's.
This  can  be  modified by placing a `%_e_x_p_o_r_t' directive in the included
script.  For a discussion of this and other ways of modifying the effect
of  %_i_n_c_l_u_d_e  see  the  manual  section giving a detailed account of the
library directives.

If the filename in a _%_i_n_c_l_u_d_e directive is enclosed  in  angle  brackets
instead  of  string quotes, this is understood to be a pathname relative
to the miralib directory.  So for example putting in your script
	%_i_n_c_l_u_d_e <ex/matrix>
brings into scope the definitions exported from the  matrix  package  in
the Miranda examples directory `ex'.  (*See note below.)

Finally, note that that the relationship between includor  and  includee
is unsymmetrical.  If file A %_i_n_c_l_u_d_e's file B, then the declarations of
B are visible to A, but not vice versa.

There is a simpler (purely textual) directive
	%_i_n_s_e_r_t "file"
which causes the contents of "file" to be substituted  for  the  %_i_n_s_e_r_t
directive during lexical analysis.  This can occur anywhere in a Miranda
script.  See manual section on compiler directives.

(*) Note  to  system  administrators:  an  empty  directory  `local'  is
provided  under the miralib directory, in which you can place additional
libraries which you wish to make available to all Miranda users at  your
site.
