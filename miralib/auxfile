notes:-
commands marked (*) are sticky, i.e. remembered for subsequent sessions
if you don't like the resident editor choose another - recommended editors
include - vi, joe, pico, nano, emacs - for more info see /man section 31(5)
/recheck enables a check for update of any relevant source file before
each evaluation, instead of only after /e[dit] - appropriate if an
editor window is kept open alongside the mira session window.
